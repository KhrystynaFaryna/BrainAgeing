# Learning to synthesise the ageing brain without longitudinal data 
The proposed method synthesises the ageing version of a given brain with preserving subject identity. The project is the code of our [MICCAI 2019 work](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32251-9_82.pdf) and [its extension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02620.pdf)

## Prerequesites
The code is coming soon. Here we first show some results in the form of ![video](https://github.com/xiat0616/BrainAgeing/blob/master/example%20results/example_video.avi) and ![image](https://github.com/xiat0616/BrainAgeing/blob/master/example%20results/example_results.png).
